Description: restricts a user's shell environment to limited sets of commands
 lshell is a shell coded in Python that lets you restrict a user's environment
 to limited sets of commands, choose to enable/disable any command over SSH 
 (e.g. SCP, SFTP, rsync, etc.), log user's commands, implement timing 
 restrictions, and more.
