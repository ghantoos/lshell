lshell - limited shell  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ghantoos/lshell.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ghantoos/lshell)
======================

lshell is a shell coded in Python, that lets you restrict a user's environment to limited sets of commands, choose to enable/disable any command over SSH (e.g. SCP, SFTP, rsync, etc.), log user's commands, implement timing restriction, and more. 

Note: all the below information (and more) can be found in the manpage - ```man -l man/lshell.1``` or ```man lshell```)

Installation:
----------------

    1. Install from source
            # on Linux:
            python setup.py install --no-compile --install-scripts=/usr/bin/
            # on *BSD:
            python setup.py install --no-compile --install-data=/usr/{pkg,local}/
    2. On Debian (or derivatives)
            apt-get install lshell
    3.  On RHEL (or derivatives)
            yum install lshell


Configuration:
------------------------

lshell.conf presents a template configuration file. See etc/lshell.conf or man file for more information.

A [default] profile is available for all users using lshell. Nevertheless,  you can create a [username] section or a [grp:groupname] section to customize users' preferences.

Order of priority when loading preferences is the following:

1. User configuration
2. Group configuration
3. Default configuration


The primary goal of lshell, is to be able to create shell accounts with ssh access and restrict their environment to a couple a needed commands and path.
 
For example User 'foo' and user 'bar' both belong to the 'users' UNIX group:

- User 'foo': 
       - must be able to access /usr and /var but not /usr/local
       - user all command in his PATH but 'su'
       - has a warning counter set to 5
       - has his home path set to '/home/users'

- User 'bar':
       - must be able to access /etc and /usr but not /usr/local
       - is allowed default commands plus 'ping' minus 'ls'
       - strictness is set to 1 (meaning he is not allowed to type an unknown command)

In this case, my configuration file will look something like this:

    # CONFIGURATION START
    [global]
    logpath         : /var/log/lshell/
    loglevel        : 2

    [default]
    allowed         : ['ls','pwd']
    forbidden       : [';', '&', '|'] 
    warning_counter : 2
    timer           : 0
    path            : ['/etc', '/usr']
    env_path        : ':/sbin:/usr/foo'
    scp             : 1 # or 0
    sftp            : 1 # or 0
    overssh         : ['rsync','ls']
    aliases         : {'ls':'ls --color=auto','ll':'ls -l'}

    [grp:users]
    warning_counter : 5
    overssh         : - ['ls']

    [foo]
    allowed         : 'all' - ['su']
    path            : ['/var', '/usr'] - ['/usr/local']
    home_path       : '/home/users'

    [bar]
    allowed         : + ['ping'] - ['ls'] 
    path            : - ['/usr/local']
    strict          : 1
    scpforce        : '/home/bar/uploads/'
    # CONFIGURATION END


Usage:
--------------

To launch lshell, just execute lshell specifying the location of your configuration file:

    lshell --config /path/to/configuration/file

In order to log a user, you will have to add him to the lshell group:

    usermod -aG lshell username

In order to configure a user account to use lshell by default, you must: (you might need to insure that lshell is listed in /etc/shells)

    chsh -s /usr/bin/lshell user_name

After this, whichever method is used by the user to log into his account, he will end up using the limited shell you configured for him!
