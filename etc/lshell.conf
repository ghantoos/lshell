[global]
##  log directory (default /var/log/lshell/ )
logpath         : /var/log/lshell/
##  set log level to 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4  (0: no logs, 1: least verbose,
##                                                 4: log all commands)
loglevel        : 2
##  configure log file name (default is %u i.e. username.log)
#logfilename     : %y%m%d-%u
#logfilename     : syslog

##  in case you are using syslog, you can choose your logname
#syslogname      : myapp

##  Set path to sudo noexec library. This path is usually autodetected, only
##  set this variable to use alternate path. If set and the shared object is
##  not found, lshell will exit immediately. Otherwise, please check your logs
##  to verify that a standard path is detected.
#path_noexec     : /usr/libexec/sudo_noexec.so

## include a directory containing multiple configuration files. These files
## can only contain default/user/group configuration. The global configuration will
## only be loaded from the default configuration file.
## e.g. splitting users into separate files
#include_dir     : /etc/lshell.d/*.conf

[default]
##  a list of the allowed commands without execution privileges or 'all' to
##  allow all commands in user's PATH
##
##  if  sudo(8) is installed and sudo_noexec.so is available, it will be loaded
##  before running every command, preventing it from  running  further  commands
##  itself. If not available, beware of commands like vim/find/more/etc. that
##  will allow users to execute code (e.g. /bin/sh) from within the application,
##  thus easily escaping lshell. See variable 'path_noexec' to use an alternative
##  path to library.
allowed         : ['ls','echo','cd','ll']

##  A list of the allowed commands that are permitted to execute other
##  programs (e.g. shell scripts with exec(3)). Setting this variable to 'all'
##  is NOT allowed. Warning do not put here any command that can execute
##  arbitrary commands (e.g. find, vim, xargs)
##
##  Important: commands defined in 'allowed_shell_escape' override their
##  definition in the 'allowed' variable
#allowed_shell_escape        : ['man','zcat']

##  a list of forbidden character or commands
forbidden       : [';', '&', '|','`','>','<', '$(', '${']

##  a list of allowed command to use with sudo(8)
##  if set to ´all', all the 'allowed' commands will be accessible through sudo(8)
#sudo_commands   : ['ls', 'more']

##  number of warnings when user enters a forbidden value before getting 
##  exited from lshell, set to -1 to disable.
warning_counter : 2

##  command aliases list (similar to bash’s alias directive)
aliases         : {'ll':'ls -l'}

##  introduction text to print (when entering lshell)
#intro           : "== My personal intro ==\nWelcome to lshell\nType '?' or 'help' to get the list of allowed commands"

##  configure your promt using %u or %h (default: username)
#prompt          : "%u@%h"

##  set sort prompt current directory update (default: 0)
#prompt_short    : 0

##  a value in seconds for the session timer
#timer           : 5

##  list of path to restrict the user "geographicaly"
##  warning: many commands like vi and less allow to break this restriction
#path            : ['/home/bla/','/etc']

##  set the home folder of your user. If not specified the home_path is set to 
##  the $HOME environment variable
#home_path       : '/home/bla/'

##  update the environment variable $PATH of the user
#env_path        : ':/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin'

##  a list of path; all executable files inside these path will be allowed 
#allowed_cmd_path: ['/home/bla/bin','/home/bla/stuff/libexec']

##  add environment variables
#env_vars        : {'foo':1, 'bar':'helloworld'}

##  allow or forbid the use of scp (set to 1 or 0)
#scp             : 1

## forbid scp upload
#scp_upload       : 0

## forbid scp download
#scp_download     : 0

##  allow of forbid the use of sftp (set to 1 or 0)
##  this option will not work if you are using OpenSSH's internal-sftp service
#sftp            : 1

##  list of command allowed to execute over ssh (e.g. rsync, rdiff-backup, etc.)
#overssh         : ['ls', 'rsync']

##  logging strictness. If set to 1, any unknown command is considered as 
##  forbidden, and user's warning counter is decreased. If set to 0, command is
##  considered as unknown, and user is only warned (i.e. *** unknown synthax)
strict          : 0

##  force files sent through scp to a specific directory
#scpforce        : '/home/bla/uploads/'

##  history file maximum size 
#history_size     : 100

##  set history file name (default is /home/%u/.lhistory)
#history_file     : "/home/%u/.lshell_history"

##  define the script to run at user login
#login_script     : "/path/to/myscript.sh"
