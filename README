#####################################

I've commented the source file (lshell.py) and the template configuration 
file (lshell.conf) as much as thought would be enough.

###
1- Installation:
###
	You have 2 options:
		* use the setup.py present in the tar. It uses python distutils to install
          everything in the right place:
			- Extract the files in the wanted directory (tar xvfz lshell.tar.gz)
			- Run: $> sudo python setup.py install
		* Install the rpm:
            - $> rpm -Uvh lshell-x.x-x.noarch.rpm

	Files tree should look something like this:

	etc/lshell.conf         ---> /etc/lshell.conf
	bin/lshell              ---> /usr/bin/lshell
	lshellmodule/lshell.py  ---> /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/lshell.py
	lshellmodule/lshell.pyc ---> /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/lshell.pyc
	CHANGES                 ---> /usr/share/doc/lshell/CHANGES
	COPYING                 ---> /usr/share/doc/lshell/COPYING
	README                  ---> /usr/share/doc/lshell/README
	log/lshell.log          ---> /var/log/lshell.log

###
2- Configuration:
###
	lshell.conf presents a template configuration file. Fields to fill are:
		* allowed: a list a the allowed commands
		* forbidden: a list of forbidden character or commands
		* warning_counter: number of warnings when user enters a 
		  forbidden value before getting exited from lshell.
		* timer: a value in seconds for the session timer
		* passwd: password of specific user
		* path: list of path to restrict the user geographicaly
		* home_path: set the home folder of your user. If not specified, the home
		  directory is set to the HOME environment variable
		* env_path: update the environment variable $PATH of the user (optional)
		* scp: 1 or 0 to allow of forbid the use of scp on a user's account
		* sftp: 1 or 0 to allow of forbid the use of sftp on a user's account

	A default profile is available to let multiple users use the same comfiguration.
	Nevertheless, you will have to create a [username] section to at least put a password.

###
3- Usage:
###
	To launch the Limited Shell, just execute lshell specifying the 
	location of your configuration file:
	$> lshell -c /path/to/configuration/file

	By default lshell will try to launch using /etc/lshell.conf unless 
	specified otherwise (using -c|--config).

###
4- Use case 1: OpenSSH & authorized_keys
###
	The primary goal of lshell, was to be able to create shell accounts 
	with ssh access	and restrict their environment to a couple a needed 
	commands. 
	For example User 'bla' who #_only_# needs to ssh from my server to 
	another machine.
	His 'allowed' variable in the configuration file will be only ['ssh'].
	In this case, my configuration file will look something like this:

	# START
	[bla]
	passwd          : blabla
	allowed         : ['ssh']
	forbidden       : [';', '&', '|'] 
	warning_counter : 2
	timer           : 0
	path            : ['/home/bla', '/usr/bla']
	home_path       : '/home/bla
	env_path        : ':/sbin:/usr/bla'
	scp             : 1 # or 0
    sftp            : 1 # or 0
	# END
	
	In order to launch lshell limited to the 'ssh' command, I used ssh's 
	authorized_keys:
	$> vi /home/bla/.ssh/authorized_keys
	and add :
		command="/path/to/lshell.py /path/to/lshell.conf",no-port-for
		warding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty
	just before the "ssh-dss blablablabla" part.

	This will have the effect of executing lshell upon user's connection.
	The great thing about it, is that when the user exist lshell, the ssh 
	session is automatically ended! : )

	Your authorized_keys should look something like this:

	no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,command=
	"/path/to/lshell.py /path/to/lshell.conf" ssh-dss AAAAHadWj4caz5T
	AA6Xgonf2FjpmpgpquvN+6cQsGTEOwm6R+oEaFBU1VyfuwlEklqn3TWnWzACBAKNJ
	cJFr6pJsECEz5LZFtGu7b4tYNu8/vne11SjZBrOqm7WuQiWpOguzyldk6IJSnIKrn
	WoT/fGgXeED2UingA65bKIvOh0B3NzaC1kc3McsrBEDjQ3NAAAAFQDP6OHwkLNSA1
	PyKqIMzqiCpAmJE7gRgFu8Pxc7i1TZvmiXSCjdXRaXZNncxPj6eOUng4QFDAoZc6n
	N8iUYCwKJ2pl2ryMqC/hnBVL5SRne+FqcRKbzWXkh7NI6KtJ4XxI32NI/OIpZAo2e
	G/8rdCgShZflCbpFZL865fKmUH2pefSZwl/12VXWDqQmukNp6+XrA3LPXdElIeQAA
	ACAHoQ3GpC4/BcxuHj1TBNg7Hw3KxZMeL1vQNVF2+cfJ22U1hERNBcRuUjqe5Gv9Q
	GoCMcsNpG8/FtV5Pnoq8nPPWuUkrBeBxY6KSgzaZ/DTSd+WvPOwNonntRkEwxpSdk
	lSqXpmqNlw2fPodg6QAAAIEVdZiSZZ9EoH+4MJjKDSvE= bla@somewhere.somet
	hing

	Now, when "sshing" to your machine, with the bla user, he will be 
	forced to lshell! And when quitting lshell, the ssh session is
	automatically ended! : )

###
5- Use case 2: /etc/passwd
###
	In order to configure a user account to use lshell by default, you 
	can force the its shell to be lshell by specifying it in /etc/passwd.
	In this case, you must: 
	 $> chsh -s /usr/bin/lshell user_name

	After this, whichever method is used by the user to log into his account,
	he will end up using the limited shell you configured for him!
